# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.


a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

def firstAndLast(a):
    newList = []
    newList.append(a[0])
    newList.append(a[-1])
    return newList

def firstAndLast2(a):
    return [a[0], a[-1]]
