# 0. A program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5

# Extras:
# 1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# 2. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

# 0. + 1.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
lessThan5 = []

for i in a:
     if i < 5:
         lessThan5.append(i)
         
print(lessThan5)


# 2.
newList = []
number = int(input('Please give a number: '))
for i in a:
     if i < number:
         newList.append(i)
print(newList)
