# Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
# Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
# Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
